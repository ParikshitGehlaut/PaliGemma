## Introduction
Paligemma-3B is a transformer-based model designed for [specific task/domain description]. This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the model along with pre-trained weights to facilitate inference.

---

## Features

- **Model Implementation**: A faithful reproduction of the Paligemma-3B model in PyTorch.
- **Pre-trained Weights**: Utilizes pre-trained weights for accurate predictions.
- **Inference Pipeline**: Includes a streamlined pipeline for performing inference with minimal setup.

---

## Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 2.0
- Transformers library (if applicable)
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Install the required packages with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParikshitGehlaut/PaliGemma.git
cd PaliGemma
```

## Usage

### Inference
1. **Download Pre-trained Weights**:
   Ensure the pre-trained weights for Paligemma-3B are downloaded and placed in the `weights/` directory.

2. **Run the Inference Script**:
   Use the provided `inference.py` script to perform inference on your input data.

   Example:
   ```bash
   python inference.py --input_file example_input.txt --output_file predictions.txt
   ```

   Command-line arguments:
   - `--input_file`: Path to the input file containing data for inference.
   - `--output_file`: Path to save the predictions.

3. **View Results**:
   Predictions will be saved to the specified output file.
